SYNOPSYS

        my $modem = Device::CableModem::SURFboard->new
            or die Device::CableModem::SURFboard->errstr;

        # print upstream power range check
        print $modem->upPowerStr . ' ' . $modem->upPowerCheck;

        # print downstream power range check
        print $modem->dnPowerStr . ' ' . $modem->dnPowerCheck;

DESCRIPTION
    The Motorola 'SURFboard' cable modem includes a built in web interface
    that contains useful information like signal to noise ratios and power
    levels. These values can be used to aid in trouble shooting modem
    connection problems, or monitoring the health of the modem or cable
    connection.

    "Device::CableModem::Surfboard" connects to several different models of
    'SURFboard' modems (currently confirmed: SB4200, SB5100, SB5100E,
    SB5101, SBV5120E), scraping the status page for the most useful
    information regarding cable line condition.

  CREATING A NEW MODEM OBJECT
        $modem = Device::CableModem::SURFboard->new();

    This will create a new modem object using default values. You can also
    initialize the modem object from an associative array reference:

        $modem = Device::CableModem::SURFboard->new(
            dnPowerMax => 16,
            dnPowerMin => -16,
            upPowerMax => 54,
            upPowerMin => 36,
            SNRatioMax => 100,
            SNRatioMin => 0,
            modemIP => '192.168.100.1',
            loginUsername => 'admin',
            loginPassword => 'motorola');

    The above example also demonstrates all of the configurable options with
    their defaults.

METHODS
    errstr()
      Returns the last error message (or empty). Currently this isn't much
      use as a method as only pageRef() (used internally) will generate
      errors. errstr() can also be called directly to determine why a new()
      method failed.

    modelGroup()
      Returns the model group found. Different models of SURFboard modems
      have different URL/page layouts. These can be grouped into similar
      model groups that share the same basic layout. When a new modem object
      is created, modelGroup will be set according to the first successful
      status page retrieved.

    channel()
      Returns the up stream channel id (number).

    upFreq()
      Returns the up stream frequency value (Hz) as a simple number.

    upFreqStr()
      Returns the up stream frequency value as a text string with the unit
      description attached. For example "25250000 Hz".

    dnFreq()
      Returns the down stream frequency value (Hz) as a simple number.

    dnFreqStr()
      Returns the down stream frequency value as a text string with the unit
      description attached. For example "477000000 Hz".

    SNRatio()
      Returns the down stream Signal to Noise ratio value (dB) as a simple
      number.

    SNRatioStr()
      Returns the down stream Signal to Noise ratio value as a text string
      with the unit description attached. For example "40.5 dB".

    SNRatioCheck()
      Checks the current down stream Signal to Noise ratio against pre-
      defined max/min limits and returns either "high", "low" or blank. The
      pre-defined max/min (default 100/0) can be also be set with the
      SNRatioMax/SNRatioMin parameters when the object is created.

    dnPower()
      Returns the down stream power value (dBmV) as a simple number.

    dnPowerStr()
      Returns the down stream power value as a text string with the unit
      description attached. For example "7.3 dBmV".

    dnPowerCheck()
      Checks the current down stream power against pre-defined max/min
      limits and returns either "high", "low" or blank. The pre-defined
      max/min (default 16/-16) can be also be set with the
      dnPowerMax/dnPowerMin parameters when the object is created.

    upPower()
      Returns the up stream power value (dBmV) as a simple number.

    upPowerStr()
      Returns the up stream power value as a text string with the unit
      description attached. For example "49.5 dBmV".

    upPowerCheck()
      Checks the current up stream power against pre-defined max/min limits
      and returns either "high", "low" or blank. The pre-defined max/min
      (default 54/36) can be also be set with the upPowerMax/upPowerMin
      parameters when the object is created.

    pageRef()
      Takes a URL path and an optional IP address to read a page from the
      modem. pageRef() is used internally to get the signal information
      page. It could also be used for grabbing other information pages from
      modems. A valid page request returns a reference to a string
      containing the page contents. A page request failure will return
      undefined (check the $errstr value or call errstr() to find out why).

SUPPORT
    This script was developed and tested on a Motorla SURFboard cable modem.
    (Models: SB4200, SB5100, SB5100E, SB5101, SBV5120E).

    It may work on other Motorla modems, but likely will not. If you have a
    different cable modem that works, or you would like to have work, please
    let me know.
